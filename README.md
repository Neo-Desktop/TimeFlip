Time Flip
=============

Description
------------

Time Flip is a beautiful widget style web-app - drawing an analogue-style flip clock, not unlike that found on HTC phones.

Due to recent API changes, and lack of support from the original author (and I mean this in the most light-hearted way possible) I have taken the responsibility to revise the already wonderful app, and have planed out several new features for it. I want to let everyone know that I use this app on a daily basis and I would hate to see it go down due to lack of support.

Many thanks to all you die hard Time Flip fans.

Update information
------------

Installing this now will upgrade you to TimeFlip v2 (with flip animations) when it's released.

Time Flip is a beautiful widget style web-app - drawing an analogue-style flip clock, not unlike that found on HTC phones.

This initial version was built in one hour immediately after the launch of the Chrome Web Store by TN2D Web Design.

We appreciate the feedback in comments, they'll help us create the next version and squash those pesky bugs.


What to know before hand (and before commenting)
------------
This is what it is; it isn't a calendar, a weather application, a stop watch or an alarm clock. It has a sole purpose of being a nicely designed clock. Future updates may include extra functionality - but that's not what the app is meant to be right now.

Above all - enjoy the app for what it is and let us know what you think it should be in future...
